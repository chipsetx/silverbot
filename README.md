SilverBot
=========

Overview
--------
SilverBot is a simple IRC bot framework written in PHP. It is crazy-easy to use and supports plugins with a fair amount of flexibility. Included in the repo are two basic pre-built plugins, one for user authentication and access control, and one for channel joining/parting.

Usage
-----
Download the code, edit as needed (it's pretty well commented), and run the bot.
    php bot.php
